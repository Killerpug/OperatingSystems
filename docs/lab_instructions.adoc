## Booting up in xv6
Compile and run xv6

### Installing tools
For this class you'll need the RISC-V versions of a couple different tools: QEMU 5.1+, GDB 8.3+, GCC, and Binutils. You can install them on Ubuntu 20.04 by:

[source,bash]
....
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install git build-essential gdb-multiarch qemu-system-misc gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu
....
From Windows, you can access all of your WSL files under the "\\wsl$\" directory. For instance, the home directory for an Ubuntu 20.04 installation should be at "\\wsl$\Ubuntu-20.04\home\<username>\". 

### Compile and run QEMU
To test your installation, you should be able to compile and run xv6.
[source,bash]
....
# in the xv6 directory. dont forget to clone xv6 OS.
$ make qemu
....

NOTE: to quit qemu type Ctrl-a x



## Lab 01: xv6 and Unix utilites
This lab will familiarize you with xv6 and its system calls. We will use xv6 system calls and construct basic UNIX programs like: sleep, pingpong, pipes, find, arguments.


### sleep
Implement the UNIX program sleep for xv6; your sleep should pause for a user-specified number of ticks. A tick is a notion of time defined by the xv6 kernel, namely the time between two interrupts from the timer chip(XV6 defines 100ms timer interrupts). Your solution should be in the file user/sleep.c.

Following the computer stack we can see in the following diagram, the overall structure for system calls(the example is the sleep program):

.system calls in xv6
[plantuml,file="system_calls_xv6.png"]
....

node "xv6 system calls" {
node "User space"{
    [//sleep.c:\n User calls sleep for "n_ticks"] as sleep
}
node "syscall interface"{
    [//usys.s:\n On startup, system maps shell "sleep" calls to kernel service "sys_sleep"] as usys.s
}
node "Kernel space"{
    [**sys_sleep**\n Kernel retrieves "n_ticks" from process info and \n schedules SLEEPING state while (system_ticks < n_ticks)] as sys_sleep
    [**trap**\n calls hardware timer and increases ticks] as trap
    [**process information**\n process->trpframe->a0: n_ticks] as process_info
}
node "Hardware"{
    [**process table**(in memory)\n processes allocate uc memory at startup.\n Each process has: \n state,\n pid,\n stack,\n size,\n user_table,\n **trapframe**:handles code during traps \n and saves user registers like arguments,\n context: structure for context switches. ] as proc
    [**timer tick**\n hardware is programmed to provide 1/10th of a second ticks] as tick
}

[sleep] -d-> [usys.s] : call sleep(n_ticks)
[usys.s] -d-> [sys_sleep] : call sys_sleep()
[sys_sleep] -r-> [process_info] : request "n_ticks" argument
[process_info] -l-> [sys_sleep] : provide "n_ticks" argument
[trap] -down-> [tick] : call timer cycle
[process_info] -down-> [proc] : look for argument\n in process memory 
[trap] -u-> [sys_sleep] : prov/req "trap_ticks"
[sys_sleep] -d-> [trap]  

}
....

#### arguments
command-line arguments are passed from the shell to the kernel using the process memory table. We retrieve the argument from process memory using argint(int an, int *ip) funciton, where an is argument_number and ip is a reference to the stored variable[type uint64].

#### user-kernel space systemcall mapping
xv6 maps user calls to kernel calls by mapping them, using a function pointer in syscall.c. Note that on usys.S and user.h we define the number of syscall to which user call is mapped from.

#### add sleep.c to build
Add your sleep program to UPROGS in Makefile; once you've done that, make qemu will compile your program and you'll be able to run it from the xv6 shell. 



### ping-pong with pipes
Write a program that uses UNIX system calls to ping-pong **a byte between two processes over a pair of pipes, one for each direction**. The parent should send a byte to the child; the child should print "<pid>: received ping", where <pid> is its process ID, write the byte on the pipe to the parent, and exit; the parent should read the byte from the child, print "<pid>: received pong", and exit. Your solution should be in the file user/pingpong.c. 

#### Inter-Process Communication
When we use *fork* in any process, file descriptors remain open across child process and also parent process. If we call fork after creating a pipe, then the parent and child can communicate via the pipe.

.Inter Process Communication with pipes
[plantuml, target=IPC_pipes, format=png]
....
node "parent process" {
[fd0, read ] as fd0parent
[fd1, write] as fd1parent
}

node "child process" {
[fd1, read ] as fd0child
[fd0, write] as fd1child
}

node "kernel" {
[ ipc_parent_to_child: parent writes, child reads] as pipe1
[ ipc_child_to_parent: child writes, parent reads] as pipe2
}

[fd1parent] -d-> [pipe1]
[fd1child] -d-> [pipe2]
[pipe1] -u-> [fd0child]
[pipe2] -u-> [fd0parent]
....

### Sieve primes
Write a concurrent version of prime sieve using pipes.  For each prime number, you will arrange to create one process that reads from its left neighbor over a pipe, drops all numbers that are divisible by that number, and writes to its right neighbor over another pipe.

image::10_primes_sieve.png[]

The idea of McIlroy can be explained as follows:
```
p = get a number from left neighbor
print p
loop:
    n = get a number from left neighbor
    if (p does not divide n)
        send n to right neighbor
```
A generating process can feed the numbers 2, 3, 4, ..., 1000 into the left end of the pipeline: the first process in the line eliminates the multiples of 2, the second eliminates the multiples of 3, the third eliminates the multiples of 5, and so on.

note: xv6 file descriptors are limited, so only feed the numbers up to 35.

#### About synchronization mechanisms
By 1978 there were many methods for communication and synchronization, *shared memory* was the most common communication mechanism, and semaphores, critical regions, and monitors were among the synchronization mechanisms.

However, Hoare addressed both issues with a single language primitive: **synchronous communication**. In Hoare's CSP language, processes communicate by sending or receiving values from named unbuffered channels. Since the channels are unbuffered, the **send operation blocks until the value has been transferred to a receiver**, thus providing a mechanism for synchronization

### find
Write a simple version of the UNIX find program: find all the files in a directory tree with a specific name. Your solution should be in the file user/find.c



## Running GDB
XV6 has a script to build Qemu debugger. However we must add a command in our root linux /home/.gdb to allow this script configurations.
[source,bash]
....
set auto-load safe-path /
#or
add-auto-load-safe-path /mnt/c/Users/path/to/os_xv6/.gdbinit     #path to xv6 OS
....


Finally, in our xv6 folder, we just add our file to debug and start the gdb server as follows:
[source,bash]
....
Console1> riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb user/_executableOfInterest

Console2> make CPUS=1 qemu-gdb      # CPUS=1 helps to debug easier
....



## Lab System calls
Keep in mind that the code for system calls is kept at:

* The user-space code for systems calls is in user/user.h and user/usys.pl.
* The kernel-space code is kernel/syscall.h, kernel/syscall.c.
* The process-related code is kernel/proc.h and kernel/proc.c. 


### Tracing syscalls
*Goal*: Add a system call tracing feature. It should:

* Take one argument, an integer "mask", whose bits specify which system calls to trace. For example, to trace the fork system call, a program calls trace(1 << SYS_fork), where SYS_fork is a syscall number from kernel/syscall.h. 
* Print out a line when each system call is about to return, if the system call's number is set in the mask. The line should contain the process id, the name of the system call and the return value.
* The trace system call should enable tracing for the process that calls it and any children that it subsequently forks, but should not affect other processes. 

#### Add a program and a system call
. Add $U/_programName to UPROGS in Makefile 
. Create the prototype stubs for the trace system call in user/user.h
. Create the stub in user/usys.pl (Makefile invokes perl usys.pl script which produces user/usys.S)
. Add a syscall number in kernel/syscall.h
. Finally implement the system call in the Kernel

#### Implementing TRACE syscall 
* Design sys_trace() inside kernel/sysproc.c to store the syscall trace-mask into *proc* structure(p->trace_mask). 
* Modify fork() to copy trace mask from parent to child process.
* Modify syscall() in kernel/syscall.c to print trace output. An array of systemcall names to index map masked syscalls to be printed.

[process] -down-> [proc] : look for argument\n in process memory

}
....


### Sysinfo 
*Goal*: Collects information about the running system.

* Takes one argument: a pointer to a struct sysinfo(kernel/sysinfo.h).
* Kernel fills out sysinfo struct:
** freemem is the number of bytes of free memory.
** nproc is the number of processes whose state is not UNUSED.

#### copyout
copyout allows us to modify user structures from the kernel, via pointers.
